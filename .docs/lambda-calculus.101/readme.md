# Let's See what the Lambda Calculus is ☄️

It's really not a complex thing. *Let's just start it with a specific code style. 🌝*

## Currying

So, what is currying ?

### 🎨 Simple

*You can take the currying just a specific style at the beginning. 🙃*

If we need an `add` function, you might: 

~~~ julia
add = (x, y) -> x + y
~~~

That maskes you can call like 

~~~ julia
add(1,2)
~~~

to get a `3` .

**Now, we need to start our changing.**

This is your `add` in our new type: 

~~~ julia
add = x -> y -> x + y
~~~

It's equal as: 

~~~ julia
add = x -> ( y -> x + y )
add = x -> ( y -> (x + y) )
~~~

And the calling for it should like: 

~~~ julia
add(1)(2)
~~~

Also got a `3` !

**And with this style you can also do something like:** 

~~~ julia
add_three = add(3)
add_three(4) # ~> 7
add_three(5) # ~> 8
~~~

**Here, the `add_three = add(3)` is just same like this:** 

~~~ julia
add_three = y -> 3 + y
~~~

**or any one of these:** 
- `add_three = x -> 3 + x`
- `add_three = z -> 3 + z`
- `add_three = foozzfii -> 3 + foozzfii`
- etc ...

**what ever ... both of them are wholely same thing.**

*(Those code lines are all Julia syntax. You can just test them on [this Julia web repl](https://keno.github.io/julia-wasm/website/repl.htm). ✨)*

OK, that's all. You've already touch all the points of *Lambda Calculus*. Funny? *Let me tell you what you just touched. 🌜*

> [!TIP]
> 
> The `add(3)` here will returns a closure: it's a function bind with a environment which just contain informations this function needed. This just like to create a special object in *OOP* style but that *'object'* can *be called like a function*.
> 
> In some language, closure is implemented as a special object. Also in some language, both all function is just a closure just with more than one syntax to create/define.

### 🏹 Lambda Calculus

*I'll tell you three point of the convert or equivalence in lambda calculus (or maybe more) by just introduce some **lexical closure** examples also. 🧪*

[Reduction | Lambda Calculus | Wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Reduction "Reduction | Lambda Calculus | Wikipedia"

#### *0*

In: 

~~~ julia
add = x -> y -> x + y
~~~

1. For closure `y -> x + y`, the `y` which at right hand of `+` is a kind of *bound variables* , because there is a `y` at left hand of this closure's `->`.
2. For closure `y -> x + y`, the `x` which at left hand of `+` is a kind of *free variables* , because there is not a `x` at left hand of this closure's `->`.
3. So, how can the interpreter knows what is the `x` ? That depends on what `x` is at the place (I mean *scope*) where this `y -> x + y` being, and that's the rule named *[lexical scoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope)*.
4. So ... Here, `y -> x + y` is the return value of `x -> y -> x + y`, so, what the `x` right side of `->` in `x -> x` will be, that the `x` right side of the first `->` in `x -> y -> x + y` will be.


#### *1*

**That means, for `add = x -> y -> x + y`, a** 

~~~ julia
add_one = add(1)
~~~

**is same as a** 

~~~ julia
add_one = y -> 1 + y
~~~

or ...

~~~ julia
add_one = y -> add(1)(y)
~~~

*That's what a closure's definition does which more than only a function's*, and, that is what the ***η-reduction*** (or *η-equivalence*) in [*Lambda Calculus*][Reduction | Lambda Calculus | Wiki] is: 

> ***η-reduction**: which captures a notion of extensionality*

#### *2*

Also, for 

~~~ julia
pipe = x -> f -> f(x)
~~~

a 

~~~ julia
pipe_four = pipe(4)
~~~

is equal with a 

~~~ julia
pipe_four = f -> f(4)
~~~

#### *3*

That's why 

~~~ julia
pipe(4)(add(1))
~~~

is same as 

~~~ julia
( f -> f(4) )( x -> 1 + x )
~~~

means 

~~~ julia
pipe_four(add_one)
~~~

result should be: 

~~~ julia
( f -> f(4) )( x -> 1 + x )
( x -> 1 + x )(4)
1 + 4
~~~

means `5`.

#### *4*

And this steps 

~~~ julia
( f -> f(4) )( x -> 1 + x )
( x -> 1 + x )(4)
1 + 4
~~~

It's the steps which called ***β-reduction*** in [*Lambda Calculus*][Reduction | Lambda Calculus | Wiki]: 

> ***β-reduction**: applying functions to their arguments*

#### *5*

And, clearly, they are both equal things: 

~~~ julia
( f -> f(4) )( x -> 1 + x )
( x -> x(4) )( y -> 1 + y )
( j -> j(4) )( a -> 1 + a )
( k -> k(4) )( i -> 1 + i )
~~~

And that's the steps called ***α-conversion*** in [*Lambda Calculus*][Reduction | Lambda Calculus | Wiki]: 

> ***α-conversion**: changing bound variables*

You can also call the relationship as [*α-equivalence*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Alpha_equivalence) between them.

#### *6*

And, if there is a *type system* in that language, for this 

~~~ julia
( f -> f(4) )( x -> 1 + x )
~~~

The type of `x -> 1 + x` should be evaluate automatically.

Because of the `f` is already applies on `f(4)` in the `f -> f(4)`.

The type of `f` left hand of `->` in `f -> f(4)` can be ensure by that `f` at `f(4)` which is right hand of `->`, cause `4` is just a number, it makes that `f`'s argument's type must be a number.

#### *7*

All we've writed is not like something kind of a `a -> a b`, they all just like the `a -> b -> a b`.

For **only** a `b -> b a`, it is a *lambda*, but it has one *unbound variable* `a` there (or called *free variable* also).

But for the `a -> b -> b a`, it is a *lambda* also, but all variables for it are *bound variables*. In that case, we call it a *Combinator*.

Examples: 

- `a -> a` **is** a *Combinator*
- `a -> a b` is **not** a *Combinator*
- `a -> b -> a b` **is** a *Combinator*
- `a -> b -> a` **is** a *Combinator*
- `b -> a` is **not** a *Combinator*
- `a -> b -> c -> c (x -> a)` **is** a *Combinator*
- `a -> b -> c -> c (x -> y)` is **not** a *Combinator*

*Done. 🌚*


### 🌪 Name

<sup>At the beginning, we just want to bind some name with their structure, which is just describe a change (or mapping, or relationship). So, the *functions* are all anonymous at the beginning in this logic, it must anonymous at the first, then it can be bind with its name we want to give for it. In math, a function can be bind with any name (such as `a` `b` `c` ...), a name (such as `f` `g` ...) also can be bind with any functions.</sup>

<sup>The *function* means a structure that shows a *transition*. And in *Lambda Calculus (λ Calculus)*, all value is such *functions*.</sup>

<sup>So, from that, things is just an anonymous function that can be treated like a value, people call them ***lambda (λ)***. But ... why *Lambda Calculus (λ Calculus)* use the symbol ***lambda (λ)*** ?</sup>

<sup>As far as I know, it is `ˆx.xx` at the first, a `^` hat on the `x` left of the `.`, then it becomes `Ʌx.xx`, then `λx.xx`. You can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Origin_of_the_%CE%BB_symbol) to get some details: </sup>

> <sup>There is some uncertainty over the reason for Church's use of the Greek letter lambda (λ) as the notation for function-abstraction in the lambda calculus, perhaps in part due to conflicting explanations by Church himself. According to Cardone and Hindley (2006):</sup>
> 
> > <sup>By the way, why did Church choose the notation `λ` ? In \[an unpublished 1964 letter to Harald Dickson\] he stated clearly that it came from the notation `ˆx` used for class-abstraction by [Whitehead and Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica), by first modifying `ˆx` to `∧x` to distinguish function-abstraction from class-abstraction, and then changing `∧` to `λ` for ease of printing.</sup>
> > 
> > <sup>This origin was also reported in \[Rosser, 1984, p.338\]. On the other hand, in his later years Church told two enquirers that the choice was more accidental: a symbol was needed and `λ` just happened to be chosen.</sup>
> > 
> 
> <sup>Dana Scott has also addressed this question in various public lectures. Scott recounts that he once posed a question about the origin of the lambda symbol to Church's former student and son-in-law John W. Addison Jr., who then wrote his father-in-law a postcard:</sup>
> 
> > <sup>Dear Professor Church,</sup>  
> > <sup>Russell had the [iota operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_operator), Hilbert had the [epsilon operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_operator). Why did you choose lambda for your operator?</sup>
> > 
> 
> <sup>According to Scott, Church's entire response consisted of returning the postcard with the following annotation: "[eeny, meeny, miny, moe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeny,_meeny,_miny,_moe)".</sup>
> 

<sup>Anyway, it's just a symbol, who knows why this symbol ... every one just call this name to mean an anonymous function that can be treated like a value.</sup>

<sup>Then, functions might have *[free variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables)* in its body. So, if such function can be treated like a value, then it must have abilities or rules for those variables' binding. We need things like that, we give them a name: *closure*.</sup>

<sup>Some binding rule is bind those *free variables* at its **[*lexical scope*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope)** (means *static scope*, another type called *[dynamic scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Dynamic_scope)*), so such closures called *Lexical Closure*, and almose all of the closures' implementations in languages is *lexical closure*.</sup>

## Combinatory Logic

*Oh did me just mention about **Combinators** ? There is something more funny ! 🌛*

This is something kind of *Lambda Calculus* called [*Combinatory Logic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic).

### 🛶 *To Mock a Mockingbird*

This is a book by *Raymond Merrill Smullyan*. He and the *Haskell Brooks Curry* both hobby on birds-watching, and in this book, all *Combinators* are analogies as *Birds*.

### 🕊️ Birds

| Bird Name | Bird Symbol | Lambda Syntax | OCaml Syntax | ES6 Syntax |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| *Identity Bird (aka Idiot)* | `I` | `λa.a` | `fun x -> x` | `x => x` |
| *Mockingbird* | `M` | `λa.aa` | `fun x -> x x` | `x => x (x)` |
| *Kestrel (True)* | `K` | `λab.a` | `fun x y -> x` | `x => y => x` |
| *Kite (False)* | `KI` | `λab.b` | `fun x y -> y` | `x => y => y` |
| *Thrush* | `T` | `λab.ba` | `fun x f -> f x` | `x => f => f (x)` |
| *Starling* | `S` | `λabc.(ac)(bc)` | `fun a b c -> a c (b c)` | `a => b => c => a (c) (b (c))` |

The `K` can used as `true` in *Lambda Calculus*, and the `false` is `KI` which can just got by `K I`: 

~~~ lambda
KI = (λxy.y) ;
K I = (λxy.x) (λa.a)
    = (λx.λy.x) (λa.a)
    = (λy.λa.a)
    = (λx.λy.y)
    = (λxy.y) = KI .
~~~

And, all things can be described by just using `S` `K` `I` those three combinators ... or just use `S` and `K` cause `I` is just `SKK` means `(((S)(K))(K))`.

This is a full (maybe) table about that from [a website](https://www.angelfire.com/tx4/cus/combinator/birds.html):
